# Introducing: BirdDog
#### A Game About a Dog chasing Birds (and other creatures)
---
Ever since I started my GD50: Introduction to Game Development class, I've wanted to design my own game from scratch. After completing the first few projects, I am now confident in my skills and ability to do just that. Drawing on inspiration from GD50, games such as Plants vs. Zombies and Mario, and my dog, Kenzie, I am proud to introduce my first independent gaming project: BirdDog!

BirdDog is a game designed in the classic side-scroller fashion about catching birds (and other animals) while simultaneously dodging not-so-fun creatures (namely cats and porcupines). I will be utilizing the LOVE2D framework, and all code and artwork will be created by me (although I will definetely be taking lots of inspiration from others).

As I am also a full time student, I have no timeframe for when this project will be completed. I am also still working on finshing GD50, so I will be trying to balance this passion project with projects from that course.

 If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to reach out! This project is purely for fun, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoy designing it.
