# BirdDog
#### A Game About a Dog chasing Birds (and other creatures)
---
Ever since I started my GD50: Introduction to Game Development class, I've wanted to design my own game from scratch. After completing the first few projects, I am now confident in my skills and ability to do just that. Drawing on inspiration from GD50, games such as _Jetpack Joyride_, and my dog, Kenzie, I am proud to introduce my first independent gaming project: BirdDog!

BirdDog is a game designed in the classic side-scroller fashion about catching birds while simultaneously dodging not-so-fun creatures (i.e., cats and porcupines). It will be written in Lua utilizing the LOVE2D framework. I will be taking heavy inspiration from GD50, utilizing several programs from that class as a template for this game.

As I am also a full time student, I have no timeframe for when this project will be completed. I am also still working on finshing GD50, so I will be trying to balance this passion project with projects from that course.

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to reach out! This project is purely for fun, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoy designing it.
