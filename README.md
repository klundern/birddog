# Introducing: BirdDog (Devlog #0)
#### A Game About a Dog chasing Birds (and other creatures)
---
Ever since I started my GD50: Introduction to Game Development class, I've wanted to design my own game from scratch. After completing the first few projects, I am now confident in my skills and ability to do just that. Drawing on inspiration from GD50, games such as Plants vs. Zomibes and Mario, and my dog, Kenzie, I am proud to introduce my first independent gaming project: BirdDog!

BirdDog is a game designed in the classic side-scroller fashion about catching birds (and other animals) while simultaneously dodging not-so-fun creatures (namely cats and porcupines). I will be utilizing the LOVE2D framework, and all code and artwork will be created by me (although I will definetely be taking lots of inspiration from others).
