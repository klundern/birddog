# BirdDog
#### A Game About a Dog chasing Birds (and other creatures)
---
Ever since I started my GD50: Introduction to Game Development class, I've wanted to design my own game from scratch. After completing the first few projects, I am now confident in my skills and ability to do just that. Drawing on inspiration from GD50, games such as _Jetpack Joyride_, and my dog, Kenzie, I am proud to introduce my first independent gaming project: BirdDog!

BirdDog is a game designed in the classic side-scroller fashion about catching birds while simultaneously dodging cats. It will be written in Lua utilizing the LÃ–VE2D framework. I will be taking heavy inspiration from GD50, utilizing several programs from that class as a template for this game.

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to reach out! This project is purely for fun, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoy designing it.

### Current Version: 0.5.0

* GameOverState when cat is collided with; displays top 5 highest scores
* EnterHighScoreState if your score is in the top 5; if not, defaults to HighScoreState
* Scores are saved to a local directory and persist across different gameplay sessions

## Future Milestones

### 0.5.1 - Pause
* Gameplay can be paused

### 0.6.0 - EntityStates
* Birds will periodically switch directions and fly in the appropriate direction when 'startled' 
* Animals (birds, cat) have various states that they transition between: idle, flying/chasing
* States are automatically triggered when player BirdDog gets close enough (birds fly, cats chase)

### 0.7.0 - Procedural Update
* Field/background is procedurally generated instead of using a static image


### Future Ideas:
* Animals are hidden in bushes and will 'flee' the bush when the BirdDog gets close enough
* Puddles and other obstacles that Player must dodge; BirdDog can 'run ahead' on-screen up to a point
* Powerups and other bonuses that may be collected
